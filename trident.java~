/*
 * Program: Trident Program
 * Student Name: Dhruv Shah
 * Student Number: 597327
 * Description: This program will collect input from the user of how they would like the trident to look
 *              The program will draw the trident according to the users information 
 *              The program calls 2 methods - welcome ( print the greeting)
 *                                          - print ( which prints the trident)
 *              The program also makes sure all of the users information is not greater than 10 
 *                   If it is then it will re ask the question
